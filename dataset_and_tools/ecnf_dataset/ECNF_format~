The parameters line is "p wcnf nbvar nbclauses top". We associate a weight with each clause, which is the first integer in the clause. Hard clauses have weight top and soft clauses have a weight smaller than top. And the weight of soft clause is equal to the penalty multiplier multiplied by its cardinality.
In each clause, the second integer is the cardinality of the clauses.

Example:

p wcnf 4 4 10
10 2 -1 -2 0
10 1 -1 -3 -4 0
3 3 1 2 3 4 0
2 2 1 -2 0
2 2 3 -4 0

The first two clauses are hard clauses with cardinality 2 and 1 respectively.
The last three clauses are soft clauses with cardinality 3, 2 and 2 respectively.
The penalty multipliers of all these soft clauses are 1, so the weight of each soft clause is equal to its cardinality.
